# Background on Docker

Docker is an open platform for system admins and developers to build, ship and runs distributed applications across diverse infrastructure ranging from Raspberry Pi like IoT devices to the Cloud. It is not longer just a GitHub project but has evolved into a production-ready product for large Enterprise IT. Traditionally, developing an application and deploying it in a production environment hasn't been an easy experience. Docker makes it quite simple by allowing developers to package their application in a portable way and operation teams to deploy it flawlessly. In the last 4 years, since the time Docker has to democratize software containers, a whole ecosystem has grown massively around containerisation. In this session, I am going to talk about the introduction of Docker, what problem does Docker solve for us, a brief about Moby Vs Docker Ecosystem and lastly a short demo on how to get started with Docker image & containers.
