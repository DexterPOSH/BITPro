# IndiaOpsUG
Umbrella User group for all things Ops in India.
This UG will only have online footprint, which means we will invite speakers to cover topics based on community votes and publish these 
sessions to a youtube channel.

# TODO
Below is what we intend to do:
- Let community vote on the session requests and determine what future topics to cover.
- Get in touch with experts across India and collaborate.
- Vendor agnostic.
- Help ops people come together and learn new things.
